									<p>As a part of the ME-170 class, students learned about the geometry and topology of engineered components: creation of engineering models and their presentation in standard 2D blueprint form and as 3D wire-frame and shaded solids; meshed topologies for engineering analysis and tool-path generation for component manufacture; ISO and ANSI standards for coordinate dimensioning and tolerancing; geometric dimensioning and tolerancing. We also covered the use  of solid-modeling software for creating associative models at the component and assembly levels with automatic blueprint creation, interference checking, and linked bill of materials.</p>
									<p>This gimbal cup holder was a result of a group project revolving around the Human Centered Design (HCD) Process.  </p>
									<p>As a group, the first step in the process was to observe. Biking on campus is very common especially at U of I, and a large amount of the student population drank coffee. But there was no reasonable way to transport coffee, or other open cup drinks while biking. The next step in HCD is ideation. We came up with various sketches of the product and reviewed designs and identified pros and cons for each. We finalized the design and moved on the next step which was to create the design in CAD. This is where we made a large portion of our material choice and manufacturing method decisions. Lastly, we outlined sourcing, manufacturing, and distribution plans to bring the design to market  </p>

								<p>The ME 270 course at UIUC introduces students to DFM methodologies and tools; material selection (new and traditional materials); designing for primary manufacturing processes (cutting fundamentals, casting, forming, and shaping); designing with plastics (snap-fits, integral hinges, etc.); design for assembly (DFA); geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T).</p>
								<p>My group and I designed a 20 step machine which was activated with a marble drop and concluded by turning off a light. The mechanical actions were designed using Fusion360 along with Creo, and the manufacturing of most mechanisms was done using a 3D printer. We also used a laser cutter for acrylic parts.</p>
								<p>What made our project special was the incorporation of electrical components along with mechanical assemblies. We included an open circuit which was closed when a metal marble was launched from a lever. The closed circuit created an electromagnet, which we constructed by wrapping wire around a nail. Additionally, we combined a pulley system with a switch to activate servo motors that were controlled by an Arduino board.</p>

									<p>At Aruba HPE, I worked to developed the mechanical design for a component used as a cooling solution for networking switches. I tested prototypes and surpased efficiency standards, increased effectiveness by 10%. I collaborated with vendors to design the part for injection molding in addition to performing tests on new products to validate thermal systems.</p>
